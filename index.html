          <p class="fourXone"> Chris Chan is quite possibly the most important person to this “genre” of content, he is the original person that people have followed, almost since the inception of the internet. His whole life, even since childbirth, has been documented by countless people. Who is he? Why are so many people interested in his life story? Why would so many people go through such great lengths to document everything he has ever done? Most people would think he is a super interesting content creator that creates things that really <a href="chrischanpage.html">...</a></p>

            <p class="sixXone"> Charlie Zelenoff is the GOAT of boxing. He is an unrivaled monster with a 328 to 0 record, at least this is what he would want you to believe.  Charlie Z is a 31 year old Russian American who tried to become a professional boxer, his career was cut short in his first fight.  He was up against a “gate keeper”, basically someone who isn’t good enough to go pro but was still good enough to keep worse people out of the scene.  Charlie suffered defeated at this man’s hand, he probably swore that day to never loose again.  He hasn’t, in his own mind at least.  After ending his boxing career 0-1 he quit and went on to make his own league, the Underground Boxing Federation, which he is the undefeated champion of. </p>

                  <p class="sixXone">LowTierGod is an infamous figure within the fighting game community for his toxic behavior and attacks on people within the community.  Before we get into him I would like to talk about the FGC for a minute as it plays a major role with his story.  The FGC is a very grass roots community starting with people betting coins in arcades almost 30 years ago.  Its self raised and built on respect for others, with or without skill.  That bit of context is important to understad why he is hated within his own community.

LowTierGod was born in the mid 1980s into a low income family somewhere around Southern California.  His early life isn’t known to much besides some of the small snip bits LTG tells his audience.  One of the main things he states about his past was his very high intelligence as an adolescent and his love for fighting games, specifically street fighter. His online presence began with his first YouTube channel, he posted vlog style videos and tried to start an acting carer.</p>

              <p class="sixXone">I love to do deep dive into weird creators online and this website is a catalogue of notable people and some of my favorite stories about them. The people on this website could be from anywhere as long as they have posted stuff online for me to look into. These people are usually very controversial and confrontational so they usually make for some good content. Grab something to snack on and dive with me into the weird world of these people.
